In this code, we are not using functional_point_id in place_actor, but instead passing the target_pose which is the pose of the displaystand's functional point 0. So, this should comply with the note.\n\nAnother thing to check: the displaystand's functional point is at the top center. So, the object should be placed there. The code uses the pose of that functional point as the target_pose, which should align the object's position and orientation to that point.\n\nAlso, the pre_dis_axis is set to 'world' instead of 'fp', which adheres to the note.\n\nAdditionally, after placing, the gripper is opened (is_open=True), which releases the object.\n\nFinally, the arm is moved back to origin, which is a good practice to reset the arm for subsequent tasks.\n\nThis should fulfill the task requirements: grasp the object with the appropriate arm and place it on the displaystand's functional point without using functional_point_id and pre_dis_axis='fp'. [unused17] To solve this problem, we need to grasp an object and place it onto a display stand using a robotic arm. The solution involves determining the appropriate arm to use based on the object's position, grasping the object, and then placing it at the specified functional point on the display stand.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Determine the Arm to Use**: Based on the object's position, decide whether to use the left or right arm. This is done by checking the x-coordinate of the object's position.\n2. **Grasp the Object**: Use the determined arm to grasp the object. This involves moving the arm to a pre-grasp position, then closing the gripper to secure the object.\n3. **Place the Object**: Move the grasped object to the target pose, which is the functional point on the display stand. This involves calculating the target pose from the display stand's functional point and using the appropriate arm to place the object there.\n4. **Reset the Arm**: After placing the object, return the arm to its initial position to avoid collisions in subsequent tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nclass gpt_place_object_stand(place_object_stand):\n    def play_once(self):\n        pass\n    \n    def execute(self):\n        # Determine the arm to use based on the object's position\n        object_pose = self.object.get_pose()\n        object_position = object_pose.p  # [x, y, z]\n        arm_tag = ArmTag(\"left\" if object_position[0] < 0 else \"right\")\n        \n        # Grasp the object with the determined arm\n        self.move(\n            self.grasp_actor(\n                actor=self.object,\n                arm_tag=arm_tag,\n                pre_grasp_dis=0.1,\n                grasp_dis=0\n            )\n        )\n        \n        # Get the target pose from the display stand's functional point 0\n        displaystand_fp = self.displaystand.get_functional_point(0, \"pose\")\n        \n        # Place the object onto the display stand\n        self.move(\n            self.place_actor(\n                actor=self.object,\n                arm_tag=arm_tag,\n                target_pose=displaystand_fp,\n                pre_dis=0.1,\n                dis=0.02,\n                is_open=True,\n                pre_dis_axis=\"world\"  # Avoid 'fp' as per the note\n            )\n        )\n        \n        # Return the arm to its origin after placing\n        self.move(\n            self.back_to_origin(arm_tag=arm_tag)\n        )\n",
