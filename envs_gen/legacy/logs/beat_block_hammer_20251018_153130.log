  "task_description": "Pick up the hammer and use it to beat the block on the table once. The hammer is placed at a fixed position on the table,                         but the block is generated randomly on the table. If the block's x coordinate (dim 0) is greater than 0, use the right arm to grasp the hammer,                         else use the left arm. To beat the block, you should place the hammer on the block's functional point                         (i.e., use the place_actor API to align the hammer's contact point with the block's functional point).                         Note: You don't need to Lift the hammer after beating the block, and you don't need to open the gripper or return the arm to origin position.",
