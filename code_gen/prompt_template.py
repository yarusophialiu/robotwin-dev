BASIC_INFO = '''
In this environment, distance 1 indicates 1 meter long. Pose is representated as 7 dimention, [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz].
For a 7-dimensional Pose object, you can use Pose.p to get the [x, y, z] coordinates and Pose.q to get the [qw, qx, qy, qz] quaternion orientation.
All functions which has parameter actor, and all of actor should be in the Actor object.
In the world coordinate system, the positive directions of the xyz coordinate axes are right, front, and upper respectively, so the direction vectors on the right, front,
and upper sides are [1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,1] respectively. In the same way, we can get the unit vectors of the left side, back side and down side.
Each actor in the environment has one or more functional points, which are specific locations designed for interactions. 
Access functional points using actor.get_functional_point(point_id, return_type), where return_type can be "pose", "p", or "q".
You can only change the params initailized with PLACEHOLDER in the play_once function, other parts of the code should not be changed.
Please do not generate any thinking process or comments in the code, only provide the code directly.

FUNCTION_EXAMPLE = '''
You can directly use the actors provided in the actor_list:
```python
# For example, if actor_list contains ["self.object1", "self.object2"]
# You can directly use:
object1 = self.hammer
object2 = self.block
```

# Using ArmTag class to represent arms:
arm_tag = ArmTag("left")  # Left arm
arm_tag = ArmTag("right")  # Right arm

# Example of selecting an arm based on conditions:
arm_tag = ArmTag("left" if actor_position[0] < 0 else "right")

# Each actor in the environment may have multiple functional points that are useful for different interactions.
# Functional points provide precise locations for interactions like grasping, placing, or aligning objects.

# To get a functional point from an actor:
```python
functional_point_pose = actor.get_functional_point(point_id, "pose")  # Returns a complete 7-dimensional Pose object with p (position) and q (orientation)
position = functional_point_pose.p  # Get [x, y, z] position of the functional point
orientation = functional_point_pose.q  # Get [qw, qx, qy, qz] quaternion orientation of the functional point
```
Note: The pose from a functional point is already set according to the expected alignment/direction for the task. For placement, use get_functional_point(point_id, "pose") directlyâ€”do NOT construct or rotate your own quaternion.

# When stacking one object on top of another (for example, placing blockA on top of blockB):
target_pose = self.last_actor.get_functional_point(point_id, "pose")
# Use this target_pose in place_actor to place the object exactly on top of last_actor at the specified functional point.
```python
self.move(
    self.place_actor(
        actor=self.current_actor,            # The object to be placed
        target_pose=target_pose,             # The pose acquired from last_actor
        arm_tag=arm_tag,
        functional_point_id=0,               # Align functional point 0, or specify as needed
        pre_dis=0.1,
        dis=0.02,
	    pre_dis_axis="fp",    # Use functional point direction for pre-displacement, if the functional point is used
    )
)
```

For all actors in `actor_list` that are of type `pose`, such as `middle_pose` or `actor_target_pose`, these are already `Pose` objects (or lists of `Pose`), so you do **not** need to call `.get_pose()` again. You can pass them directly as `target_pose`.
Example:
```python
# Place the actor at actor_pose (already a Pose object)
self.move(
    self.place_actor(
        self.box,
        target_pose=self.actor_pose,  # already a Pose, no need for get_pose()
        arm_tag=grasp_arm_tag,
        functional_point_id=0,     # functional_point_id can be retrived from the actor list if the actor has functional points
        pre_dis=0,
        dis=0,  # set dis to 0 if is_open is False, and the gripper will not open after placing. Set the `dis` to a small value like 0.02 if you want the gripper to open after placing.
        is_open=False, # if is_open is False, pre_dis and dis will be 0, and the gripper will not open after placing.
        constrain="free", # if task requires the object to be placed in a specific pose that mentioned in the task description (like "the head of the actor should be toward xxx), you can set constrain to "align", in all of other cases, you should set constrain to "free".
        pre_dis_axis='fp',  # Use functional point direction for pre-displacement, if the functional_point_id is used
    )
)
```
Note: For the `target_actor`, It's a actor not a Pose, so you need to call `get_pose()` to get its pose. or call `get_functional_point()` to get its functional point.


For the grasping of a certain actor, you can check its position to decide which arm to use:
```python
# Get the actor's pose
actor_pose = self.actor.get_pose()  # Use actor_pose.p for position, actor_pose.q for orientation
actor_position = actor_pose.p  # [x, y, z]

# Example of selecting an arm based on conditions:
arm_tag = ArmTag("left" if actor_position[0] < 0 else "right")

# Grasp actor with selected arm
self.move(
    self.grasp_actor(actor=self.actor, arm_tag=arm_tag)
)
```

Here are some APIs and examples of grasping objects:
If you want to grasp an actor, you typically execute the following code:
```python
# Or grasp with arm_tag
self.move(
    self.grasp_actor(
        actor=self.actor, 
        arm_tag=arm_tag,        # arm_tag can be ArmTag("left") or ArmTag("right")
        pre_grasp_dis=0.1, 
        grasp_dis=0
    )
)
```

If you want to pick up an actor and lift it, you can refer to the following sample code:
```python
# Grasp the object
self.move(
    self.grasp_actor(
        actor=self.actor, 
        arm_tag=arm_tag,  # arm_tag can be ArmTag("left") or ArmTag("right") 
        pre_grasp_dis=0.1, 
        grasp_dis=0
    )
)

# Lift the object up by moving relative to current position, you should lift the arm up evrery time after grasping an object to avoid collision.
self.move(
    self.move_by_displacement(
        arm_tag=arm_tag,
        z=0.07,  # Move 7cm upward
        move_axis='world'
    )
)
```
The code for grasping with the right arm is similar to the above code.

Here are some examples of gripper control:
```python
# Open gripper fully
self.move(
    self.open_gripper(arm_tag=arm_tag, pos=1.0)  # arm_tag can be ArmTag("left") or ArmTag("right")
)

# Open gripper halfway
self.move(
    self.open_gripper(arm_tag=arm_tag, pos=0.5) # arm_tag can be ArmTag("left") or ArmTag("right")
)

# Close gripper fully
self.move(
    self.close_gripper(arm_tag=arm_tag, pos=0.0) # arm_tag can be ArmTag("left") or ArmTag("right")
)

# Close gripper halfway
self.move(
    self.close_gripper(arm_tag=arm_tag, pos=0.5) # arm_tag can be ArmTag("left") or ArmTag("right")
)
```

Here are some APIs and examples of placing objects:
To place an object at a target location, you typically execute the following code:
```python
# Place the object at a specific target pose
self.move(
    self.place_actor(
        actor=self.actor,
        arm_tag=arm_tag,
        target_pose=self.target_pose, # self.target_pose can be retrived from the actor list. 
        functional_point_id=0,  # functional_point_id can be retrived from the actor list if the actor has functional points
        pre_dis=0.1,
        dis=0.02, # set dis to 0 if is_open is False, and the gripper will not open after placing. Set the `dis` to a small value like 0.02 if you want the gripper to open after placing.
        is_open=True,  # Controls gripper state after placing: True to release object (default), False to maintain grip on object
        pre_dis_axis='fp',  # Use functional point direction for pre-displacement, if the functional_point_id is used
    )
)

# Lift the gripper up after placing to avoid collision with the object. (Only needed if is_open is True when placing, which means the object is released)
self.move(
    self.move_by_displacement(
        arm_tag=arm_tag,
        z=0.07,  # Move 7cm upward
        move_axis='world'  # Move in world coordinates
    )
```

If you want to align a functional point of the object with the target, you can specify the functional_point_id:
```python
# Place the object by aligning functional point 0 with the target pose
self.move(
    self.place_actor(
        actor=self.actor,
        arm_tag=arm_tag,
        target_pose=target_pose,
        functional_point_id=0, # functional_point_id can be retrived from the actor list if the actor has functional points
        pre_dis=0.1,
        dis=0.02,  # set dis to 0 if is_open is False, and the gripper will not open after placing.
        pre_dis_axis='fp'  # Use functional point direction for pre-displacement, if the functional_point_id is used
    )
)
```

If both arms need to work together simultaneously, use the move() function with two arm actions:
```python
# Move both arms simultaneously
left_arm_tag = ArmTag("left")
right_arm_tag = ArmTag("right")
self.move(
    self.grasp_actor(actor=self.left_actor, arm_tag=left_arm_tag),
    self.grasp_actor(actor=self.right_actor, arm_tag=right_arm_tag)
)

# Lift both actors up after grasping
self.move(
    self.move_by_displacement(arm_tag=left_arm_tag, z=0.07),  # Move left arm up by 10cm
    self.move_by_displacement(arm_tag=right_arm_tag, z=0.07)  # Move right arm up by 10cm
)
```


Place left object while moving right arm back to origin
```python
move_arm_tag = ArmTag("left")  # Specify which arm is placing the object
back_arm_tag = ArmTag("right")  # Specify which arm is moving back to origin
self.move(
    self.place_actor(
        actor=self.left_actor,
        arm_tag=move_arm_tag,
        target_pose=target_pose,
        pre_dis_axis="fp",
    ),
    self.back_to_origin(arm_tag=back_arm_tag)
)
```
The code for placing with the right arm is similar to the above code.

To return arms to their initial positions:
```python
# Return arm to origin
self.move(self.back_to_origin(arm_tag=arm_tag))

# Return both arms to origin simultaneously
left_arm_tag = ArmTag("left")
right_arm_tag = ArmTag("right")
self.move(
    self.back_to_origin(arm_tag=left_arm_tag),
    self.back_to_origin(arm_tag=right_arm_tag)
)
```
